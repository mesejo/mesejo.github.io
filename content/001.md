Summary: Hello World and goals.

This is the *first post* from my blog (currently powered by Pelican). This blog has several goals:

1. To act as a documentation of my path to become a Software Engineer. So this is going to be a very selfish endeavour
but hopefully some people will also benefit from my writings.

2. I intend to write at least one post per week, so you can think of these as a sort of weekly blog.

3. I'm going to write mostly about software through a Python lens, meaning that I will try to address what I consider
general problems from a Python perspective.

So without further due:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

I always wanted to write those words for the whole Internet to see.
